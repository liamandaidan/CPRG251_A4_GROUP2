This program will connect to a relational database called Movies and allows the user to 
make modifications to the system. SQL queries will be used to create, search by year
list a random number of movies, and delete movies. Once changes had been made to the
database, they will be displayed to the user and will be retrieved and persisted on demand. 
Any exceptions that occur due queries or invalid user input have been handled. 

How to run this program: 

sait.mms.application > AppDriver.java > run as java application
